Unix is a multitasking, multi-user computer operating system originally
developed in 1969 by a group of AT&T employees at Bell Labs, including
Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, Douglas McIlroy,
and Joe Ossanna.

The Unix operating system was first developed in assembly language,
but by 1973 had been almost entirely recoded in C, greatly facilitating
its further development and porting to other hardware.
Today's Unix system evolution is split into various branches,
developed over time by AT&T as well as various commercial vendors,
universities (such as University of California, Berkeley's BSD),
and non-profit organizations.

The Open Group, an industry standards consortium, owns the UNIX trademark.
Only systems fully compliant with and certified according to the Single
UNIX Specification are qualified to use the trademark;
others might be called Unix system-like or Unix-like,
although the Open Group disapproves[1] of this term.
However, the term Unix is often used informally to denote any operating
system that closely resembles the trademarked system.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic
circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix(particularly of the BSD variant,
originating from the University of California, Berkeley) by
commercial startups, the most notable of which are Solaris, HP-UX and AIX,
as well as Darwin, which forms the core set of components upon
which Apple's Mac OS X, Apple TV, and iOS are based.
Among all variants of Unix, the most widely used are
Linux, which is used to power data centers, desktops, mobile phones,
and embedded devices such as routers, set-top boxes or e-book readers.
Today, in addition to certified Unix systems such as those already
mentioned, Unix-like operating systems such as MINIX, Linux, Android,
and BSD descendants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly BSD) are
commonly encountered.

The term traditional Unix may be used to describe a Unix or
an operating system that has the characteristics of either Version 7
Unix or UNIX System V. x1
